# Reach more riders and improve public transit with GTFS
GTFS, the open-source standard for transit data, empowers you to make public transportation more accessible and efficient.

GTFS serves as the backbone of modern transit systems, enabling agencies to provide accurate and up-to-date information to riders, app developers, and policymakers. Below, we'll explore the various benefits of GTFS and how it enhances public transit worldwide.

## GTFS: More Than Just Trip Planning

While trip planning is a core function, GTFS offers additional features that enhance the transit experience:

- **Fares:** GTFS can include fare information for accurate cost breakdowns across routes and journey options.
- **Flexible services:** GTFS can describe demand-responsive options like dial-a-ride, route deviations and, other services that do not follow the common behavior of scheduled and/or fixed service.
- **Pathways:** GTFS can model large transit stations, helping riders navigate from station entrances and exists to the location where they board or disambark from a transit vehicle.

## Global Reach & Seamless Trips

Over 10,000 agencies in 100+ countries use GTFS, ensuring consistent data for multi-agency trips and simplifying travel across regions. Here's how GTFS facilitates global reach and seamless trips:

- **Standardized Data:** GTFS provides a standardized format for transit data, ensuring consistency across agencies and regions, simplifying travel planning for riders.
- **Multi-Agency Trips:** GTFS enables agencies to share consistent, reliable data, facilitating seamless travel experiences for riders traveling across multiple transit systems.

## Simplified Data Sharing

GTFS fosters collaboration between transit agencies by enabling easy data exchange, promoting smoother service integration, and information sharing. Here's how GTFS simplifies data sharing:

- **Collaborative Development:** GTFS is collaboratively developed, ensuring the format remains relevant to meet the evolving needs of riders and agencies.
- **Ease of Integration:** GTFS makes it easy for agencies to get started with a simple data structure using common file formats like .txt and GeoJSON, fostering collaboration and interoperability.

## Wider User Base for Apps & Services

By adopting GTFS, agencies reach a wider audience through the vast pool of app developers utilizing the standardized data format. Here's how GTFS expands the user base for apps and services:

- **Expanded App Reach:** Access to GTFS data allows app developers to reach a wider audience of transit riders, enhancing the usability and functionality of transit apps.
- **Interoperability:** Open standards facilitate seamless data exchange between transit agencies and app developers, promoting interoperability and collaboration.

## Open Data: More Opportunity and Choices

Unlocking the potential of open data, GTFS offers numerous benefits for both agencies and riders:

- **Wide Accessibility:** GTFS serves as an Open Standard, enabling agencies to easily share transit information through various tools supporting GTFS.
- **Diverse Applications:** This fosters a broad spectrum of applications and services, ranging from popular trip planners to innovative solutions.
- **Rider Empowerment:** Riders enjoy the freedom to choose the app that best fits their needs, whether prioritizing accessibility features, simplicity, or cutting-edge innovation.

## Maintained by the Community

GTFS thrives on community collaboration, ensuring its continuous evolution and relevance:

- **Open Collaboration:** GTFS operates as an open data standard, allowing anyone to contribute changes or improvements.
- **Guided Evolution:** The specification evolution is overseen by an independent nonprofit organization called [MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org/), and its changes are guided by the principles of ease of use, backwards-compatibility, and pragmatic change. The specification is primarily concerned with passenger information.
- **Community-driven Development:** The GTFS specification undergoes continuous refinement through input and review from the community, facilitated on platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Slack](https://share.mobilitydata.org/slack).
